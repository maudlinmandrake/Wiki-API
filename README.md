# Wiki-API

What's an API? What the heck is a RESTful API?! The purpose of this project is to build up my own API using the principles of REST (an architectural style for building an API). This particular API taps into an admittedly tiny database of web development principles, using GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and PATCH to fetch, manipulate and delete data inside the database.
